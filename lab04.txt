1. What python mechanism keeps the game running?
The whileTrue mechanism. As long as the statement is still true, the game will keep running.

2. How does your program know when you win?
The program knows when you win by the elif condition. If the statement was true, it will record a win (wins = wins + 1).

3. What type of flow control is used in this program?
I think the flow control used is iteration.

4. How would you expand on this program? For multiple players? How about adding "Lizard" and "Spock" as a popular alternative/expansion?

You could expand on this program by adding more elif conditions and random numbers for the computer to chose from.

For multiple players you could make it so each player has to take turns going aginst the computer. 

You could do so by adding "Lizard" and "Spock" to the elif statements to display and record, and adding more randomNumbers for the computer to chose from. 
(ex: randomNumber == random.randint(1,5))(ex: elif playerMove == 'Lizard' and computerMove == 'Spock': print('You lose!') losses = losses + 1)
