From what i've  gathered, it's you vs the computer and you take turns entering a number 1, 2, or 3 then it adds to the total. Whoever gets to 21 first wins.

It seems like the rules are: you can't go above 21.

When the computer hits 21 points the output shows "I win" (that the computer won).

If the computer hits 22 points the output shows that I, the player won ("You win").

I think the flow control used is the if-else.

Decisions are being made by if and else statements. For example, if the total points are >=21 I win, else <21 continue the game.

The game keeps running because of the while true statement. As long as the code is true it will continute if not the break will exit the game.

The games knows to exit because of the breaks. It will continue on until a statement is no longer true.
